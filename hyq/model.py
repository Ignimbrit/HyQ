    This class is the backbone to set up and run a model to calculate what happens to an aquifers head (which
    for unconfined aquifers we shall think of as "the groundwater surface" for now) when you start using pumping
    wells to extract groundwater

    Attributes:
        grid: A dict containing the spatial discretisation of the model. Set up by set_grid method.
        aquifer: A dict containing aquifer parameters. Set up by set_aquiferparams method.
        wells: A list of pumping wells. Set up by add_wells method.
        timesteps: A list of points in time [seconds since pumping started] to model. Set up by set_timesteps method.
        H: A list of numpy arrays giving the aquifer head at the designated timesteps. Model result.

        the resolution of the calculation raster and the position of the model in real world space. As for the latter,
